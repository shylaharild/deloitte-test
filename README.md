# Deloitte DevOps Recruitment Test

## Python generate ramdom number between 1 & 100

The programs generates random number between 1 and 100 when it is called using the HTTP GET endpoint. This program runs on AWS Lambda functions and uses the API Gateway to serve the HTTP endpoint.

Once you access the endpoint url, it will respond with the following.

```bash
{"message": "The number is 73"}
```

In the above example, the number "73" is generated by the python code in the lambda function invoked by the trigger when the user accessed the API Gateway endpoint

## CloudFormation templates

There are two CloudFormation templates involved in this task.

* deployment-resources.yaml
* random-number.yaml

## deployment-resources.yaml
This CloudFormation template creates the S3 bucket for the application archives to be uploaded for the lambda function in the `random-number.yaml` template to access. This is made separate because the next template requires to archive to be available in the given location.

This stack can also be used to create the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline. Hence the name deployment-resources.

## random-number.yaml
The CloudFormation template is the main template responsible to create Lambda function, API Gateway and other required resources for the application to run. This template has few parameters which is required for the resources mentioned in the Resource section to be created. This template also imports the output of the `deployment-resources.yaml` template so it is essential to have a successful creation of the  `deployment-resources.yaml` stack before launching this template.

The steps to use are provided below.
