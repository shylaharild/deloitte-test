## Python generate ramdom number between 1 & 100

The programs generates random number between 1 and 100 when it is called using the HTTP GET endpoint. This program runs on AWS Lambda functions and uses the API Gateway to serve the HTTP endpoint.

Once you access the endpoint url, it will respond with the following.

```bash
{"message": "The number is 73"}
```

In the above example, the number "73" is generated by the python code in the lambda function invoked by the trigger when the user accessed the API Gateway endpoint
